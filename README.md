Classification model

The historical dataset is from loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. I used the following algorithms to build your models:

* k-Nearest Neighbour
* Decision Tree
* Support Vector Machine
* Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

* Jaccard index
* F1-score
* LogLoass
